<p>I'm a native Texan who would describe myself as 50% Buddha and 50% Beyonce. I choose to live my life consciously from a space centered in love, compassion, and gratitude. On the other hand, I have a sassy, independent side who works hard for what she wants and knows her worth. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I moved to Austin in 2007 to complete my Bachelor's Degree from St. Edward's University. After graduation, I moved to San Francisco, CA where I landed my first job in the tech start-up scene. I held roles in Customer Experience for a few years, before returning home to Austin where I continued to work in tech spaces. During my decade long tenure working in CX roles, I observed the ins and outs of the tech sector, and how each department serves an important role in the health of each company's ecosystem. I took a particular interest in web development and held a strong curiosity for what I consider to be "the future of our society". This combined with my desire to see more women engineers led me to where I am today. A future web developer. As an educated and empowered woman in today's ever-changing society, I wish to be the change I want to see in this world. By saying yes to this new journey through technology, I am opening doors for future generations of young women.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy running, cycling, yoga, reading, binging crime shows, getting lost in the beauty of nature, star-gazing, and playing with my 2 dogs Ernie and Gussie. I am a fierce supporter of human rights, equality, and seeing more women in STEM. I believe in the power of positive thinking, and also in the power of not taking ourselves too seriously. At the end of the day, we're all just floating on a giant rock in the middle of space for 80 years or so until our time runs out. I want to make the most of my time here. Dream B I G!</p>
