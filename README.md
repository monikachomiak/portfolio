# Project Description



# Expected Behavior

When a user opens the page, multiple images will appear as you continue to scroll down the page. Each image has an alt text with a short desription.

When a user opens the page,they will see 3 content elements horizontally listed in the header: Social Media Marketing, Online Reputation Management, and Search Engine Optimization. Clicking on any one of these elements will direct you to that specific section on the web page.

When a user views the page, they will find that the HTML elements meet accessibility standards and fall in sequential order.
